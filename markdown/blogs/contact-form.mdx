title: "Why Seamless Integration Is Key to Optimizing Your Prepress Workflow"
excerpt: |
  Your team likely relies on a range of different tools to get the job done, from Adobe Creative Suite to RIP software, color management systems, and beyond. But what happens when these tools don’t talk to each other? You end up with inefficiencies, errors, and longer production times. With our Prepress Project & Task Management System, seamless integration is built-in. Whether you're working in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, or any other industry-standard tool, our platform connects with the tools you already use to ensure a smooth workflow.

## Introduction

This part of the documentation shows you how you can configure a contact form with Tailwind CSS Templates and Bootstrap Templates.

## Using PHP Contact Form:

For Bootstrap templates, we used to provide a PHP script that only can be used for PHP servers,

if `phpmailer` function is up and running smoothly.

Here is how it works: Just **replace the email address with your own** from

```bash
assets->php>contact.php
```

This procedure should work if everything is configured properly on the server side.

## Using FormBold: A universal Form API (Recommended):

[FormBold](https://formbold.com/) is a powerful form API and serverless form backend that works with all hosting, SSG, and frameworks.

We highly recommend, using a serverless end-point ([FormBold](https://formbold.com/)) to make contact form dynamic. Since most users nowadays don't use PHP servers.

Here’s how to connect [FormBold](https://formbold.com/) API with your contact form:

**Step#1**: Create an account on [FormBold](https://formbold.com/) and create a Form.

**Step#2**: Integrate the API into your contact Form using this code. Make sure your Form’s method is set to **POST**

```html
<form action="https://formbold.com/s/unique_form_id" method="POST">
  <input type="email" placeholder="email" name="email" />
  <input type="text" placeholder="subject" name="subject" />
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="message"></textarea>

  <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
</form>
```

You’ll find the `unique_form_id` in the [FormBold](https://formbold.com/) dashboard under \***\*Settings>Integration.\*\***

Copy and paste it to the **action** attribute.

This is just the basic setup, FormBold has a lot of great features like re-captcha for spam protection, and the ability to integrate it with other apps like Webhook, Slack, Notion, and GoogleSheet.
